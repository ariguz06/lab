__Graph diameter__

To get a good approximation of diameter on a graph V:

Take a random sample of V, get a vertex v

eccentricity(v) (as given by bfs(v)) = u, i.e. u is the furthest possible vertex from v

d(u, v) >= 1/2 diameter by triangle inequality theorem

2d(u, v) >= diameter

d(u, v) <= diameter

__Tree decomposition__ 

Elimination ordering algorithm uses optimal bag size for tree decomposition 

Cycles of size greater than 3 -- add chords to make every cycle have 3 edges 

_Simplicial vertex_ := a vertex _v_ if its neighbors form a _clique_ if _v_ were to be removed 

Elimination ordering: remove any _v_, take its neighbors, the vertex and its neighbors form a bag, but the neighbors of _v_ must form a clique 

To determine edges between bags, union neighbors of every element in bag at that remaining point in elimination ordering
